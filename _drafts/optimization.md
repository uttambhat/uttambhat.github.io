# On Optimization and its overuse

- Optimization is framework to identify a measure of an outcome that we are interested in, identify variables that affect this outcome, and use mathematical / computing tools to minimize or maximize this measure
- I have a background in optimization. My PhD was on stochastic optimization
- Optimization is a very narrow framework. The necessary ingredients are:
  - A single measure / objective
  - Other stuff
  - E.g: Shipping time optimization
- Optimization gets hairy very quickly, e.g: when there are multiple objectives or measures that we are interested in
  - E.g: What does evolution optimize (or appear to optimize) is a contentious topic
  - "Optimize life" or "Optimize society" is a meaningless statement.
