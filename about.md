I am a scientist with a background in physics, ecology, machine learning, and data science. I currently work at [Climate LLC](https://climate.com/en-us.html) where I develop predictive models to forecast agricultural outcomes.

In the past I worked as a postdoctoral scholar at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/) with the [Munch Lab](https://sbmunch.sites.ucsc.edu/), at [University of California, Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu) with the [Yeakel Lab](https://jdyeakel.github.io/), and as a PhD student at [Santa Fe Institute](https://santafe.edu/) and [Boston University](https://www.physics.bu.edu/) with [Sidney Redner](https://sites.santafe.edu/~redner/).

You can find a more detailed description of my research interests [here](/research), and here are links to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8AVQ7NgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [GitHub](https://github.com/uttambhat) profiles.

I also enjoy making music. You can find my soundtracks [here](https://soundcloud.com/uttambhat13).
