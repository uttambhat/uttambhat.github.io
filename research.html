			<h2>Foraging Ecology</h2>
			<p>Foraging is a fundamental process in ecology through which energy flows between the different trophic levels. The rate of gathering food sets a number of constraints on the sizes and fitness of animals/consumers existing in a habitat. The fitness is affected by environmental variables like the average amount of food available and it's variability, and also by the foraging strategy employed by the consumer. We study simple to understand the relationships between the different environmental, behavioral and physiological parameters using the most basic ingredients. We find a number of surprising results that show trade-offs that exist while trying to maximize fitness. For example, we show that greed can both help <em>and</em> hurt depending on spatial dimensions! (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.062119">PRE2017</a>). There also exist optimal ways of being frugal (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.97.022110">PRE2018</a>) and ignorant (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08045">arXiv</a>) to maximize fitness. Our latest model which incorporates more physiological variables also suggest that striking trade-offs exist in investing resources in offsprings, optimizing litter-size and self-preservation. These results are also applicable to a larger class of problems of investment in presence of fluctuating resource availability.</p>
			
			<h2>Random walks and First Passage Processes</h2>
			<p>Understanding random walks is fundamental to understanding stochastic processes. Random walks have been studied for over a century and yet there are aspects of it that are not fully understood. We use random walks and first-passage process principles and tools to model basic stochastic search processes, yielding us noon-trivial insights about how fluctuations play a role in search processes. </p>
			
			<h2>Complex Networks</h2>
			<p>Network theory has seen an exponential increase in interest and research over the last few decades. Statistical physics, which traditionally was developed to deal with Euclidean lattices, provides very useful tools to study properties of networks and processes on them. We study simple generative processes that lead to highly clustered networks, and also try to understand the implications these processes have on the connectivity properties of such networks. </p>
			
			<h2>Lattice gases, binary sequences and other probability problems</h2>
			<p>I am also interested in fundamental processes in discrete probability. </p>
